# Chordify
During ISMIR 2013 in Porto, Portugal, Bas de Haas presented the beta-version of a service that used to the power of Music Information Retrieval technology to give musicians the chords for any song in the blink of an eye. Only a few months later the service was officially launched under the name of [Chordify](https://chordify.net/). Since then, Chordify has evolved into a thriving company with about 40 employed music enthusiasts and millions of users every month.

## Research
At Chordify, we bring applied MIR research to millions of musicians around the world. Our products ([chordify.net](https://chordify.net/) and [KARANG](https://karang.app/)) are built on MIR algorithms for
- Automatic Chord Estimation
- Beat Tracking
- Tempo Estimation
- Tuning Frequency Estimation
- Audio Fingerprinting
- Music Recommendation
- Music Auto-Tagging
- Real-time Monophonic and Polyphonic F0-Estimation

and more. We develop and implement most of our technology in-house.

## Recent Publications
We know that without the scientific MIR community we could not have built Chordify. We therefore actively aim to contrubute to the community as well. Recent publications in which Chordify was actively involved in include

**[Annotator Subjectivity in Harmony Annotations of Popular Music](https://github.com/chordify/CASD)**\
*Hendrik Vincent Koops, W. Bas de Haas, John Ashley Burgoyne, Jeroen Bransen, Anna Kent-Muller, Anja Volk*\
Journal of New Music Research 48(3), 2019

**[Towards Automatically Correcting Tapped Beat Annotations for Music Recordings](https://github.com/chordify/tapcorrect)**\
*Jonathan Driedger, Hendrik Schreiber, W. Bas de Haas, and Meinard Müller*\

## Collaboration Opportunity
If you are interested in doing a (remote) research stay, internship, PhD- or Masters project with us to conduct joint research in one of the fields listed above, please reach out to Jonathan Driedger at [jonathan@chordify.net](mailto:jonathan@chordify.net) to discuss opportunities. We are looking forward to hearing from you!
