# Chordify

This is where I believe we can put in some more generic info text about Chordify.

## Research
At Chordify, we bring applied MIR research to millions of musicians around the world. Our products ([chordify.net](https://chordify.net/) and [KARANG](https://karang.app/)) are built on MIR algorithms for
- Automatic Chord Estimation
- Beat Tracking
- Tempo Estimation
- Tuning Frequency Estimation
- Audio Fingerprinting
- Music Recommendation
- Music Auto-Tagging
- Real-time Monophonic and Polyphonic F0-Estimation
and more. We develop and implement most of our technology in-house

## Recent Publications
We know that without the scientific MIR community we could not have built Chordify. We therefore actively aim to contrubute to the community as well. Recent publications in which Chordify was actively involved in include

**[Annotator Subjectivity in Harmony Annotations of Popular Music](https://github.com/chordify/CASD)**\
*Hendrik Vincent Koops, W. Bas de Haas, John Ashley Burgoyne, Jeroen Bransen, Anna Kent-Muller, Anja Volk*\
